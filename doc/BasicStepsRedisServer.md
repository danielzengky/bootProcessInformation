
## Introduction to Redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), **in-memory** data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker.

The data model is **key-value**, but many different kind of values are supportã€‚

It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
